# Sure, here's a Python program that can accomplish the tasks you've described. You'll need to have the pandas library installed to run it.

import pandas as pd

# Load the CSV file into a pandas dataframe
df = pd.read_csv('orders.csv')

# Convert the order_date column to a datetime datatype
df['order_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['order_date'])

# Compute the total revenue generated by the online store for each month in the dataset
revenue_by_month = df.groupby(df['order_date'].dt.to_period('M'))['product_price'].sum()

# Print the revenue by month
print("Revenue by Month:")
print(revenue_by_month)

# Compute the total revenue generated by each product in the dataset
revenue_by_product = df.groupby(['product_id', 'product_name'])['product_price'].sum()

# Print the revenue by product
print("\nRevenue by Product:")
print(revenue_by_product)

# Compute the total revenue generated by each customer in the dataset
revenue_by_customer = df.groupby('customer_id')['product_price'].sum()

# Print the revenue by customer
print("\nRevenue by Customer:")
print(revenue_by_customer)

# Identify the top 10 customers by revenue generated
top_10_customers = revenue_by_customer.sort_values(ascending=False).head(10)

# Print the top 10 customers
print("\nTop 10 Customers by Revenue:")
print(top_10_customers)


#This program uses the groupby method in pandas to group the data by month, product, and customer, and then computes the sum of the product_price column for each group. The sort_values method is
