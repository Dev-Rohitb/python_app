# Desrciption about the Python_App and how to dockerize it.

This Python program uses the pandas library to analyze a dataset of orders. Here's a breakdown of what the program does:

1.It imports the pandas library and loads a CSV file called "orders.csv" into a pandas dataframe using the read_csv() function.

2.The to_datetime() method is used to convert the order_date column of the dataframe into a datetime datatype. This allows for easier manipulation of the data based on dates.

3.The groupby() method is used to group the data by month using the dt.to_period('M') function, and compute the total revenue generated by the online store for each month.

4.The program then prints the revenue by month.

5.The groupby() method is used again to group the data by product and compute the total revenue generated by each product in the dataset.

6.The program then prints the revenue by product.

7.The groupby() method is used once more to group the data by customer and compute the total revenue generated by each customer in the dataset.

8.The program then prints the revenue by customer.

9.The sort_values() method is used to sort the revenue by customer in descending order and identify the top 10 customers by revenue generated.

10.Finally, the program prints the top 10 customers.


#Dockerrizing the Pythong App

To Dockerize the Python code, we can follow the below steps:
1.	Create a Dockerfile - this is a text file that contains instructions for building a Docker image.
2.	In the Dockerfile, specify the base image you want to use, copy the Python script and dependencies into the image, and define the commands to be executed when the image is run.
3.	Build the Docker image using the Dockerfile.
4.	Run the Docker container based on the image you just built.
