# Desrciption about the Test and how to dockerize it.

This Python program is using the unittest framework to test data analysis functions on a pandas dataframe containing order data. The program defines a TestOrderDataAnalysis class that inherits from the TestCase class provided by the unittest module.

1.The setUp method is used to load the CSV file 'orders.csv' into a pandas dataframe and convert the 'order_date' column to a datetime datatype.

2.The program defines four test methods: test_revenue_by_month, test_revenue_by_product, test_revenue_by_customer, and test_top_10_customers.

3.The test_revenue_by_month method computes the total revenue generated by the online store for each month in the dataset and checks that the revenue is not empty.

4.The test_revenue_by_product method computes the total revenue generated by each product in the dataset and checks that the revenue is not empty.

5.The test_revenue_by_customer method computes the total revenue generated by each customer in the dataset and checks that the revenue is not empty.

6.The test_top_10_customers method computes the total revenue generated by each customer in the dataset, identifies the top 10 customers by revenue generated, and checks that the top 10 customers are not empty.

7.To run the tests, we can simply run the Python file containing the tests, which will execute the unittest.main() function and run all the tests. If any test fails, the framework will print an error message indicating which test failed and why.



# To Run The Test, follow the steps below:
1.	Save the script in a file with a .py extension, for example, test_order_data_analysis.py.
2.	Make sure that the orders.csv file is located in the same directory as the script.
3.	Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is located.
4.	Run the script by typing the following command:

Copy code:
python test_order_data_analysis.py 

5.	The script will execute all the tests defined in the TestOrderDataAnalysis class and print the test results to the console.
6.	If all the tests pass, you will see a message indicating that all the tests have passed. If any test fails, the framework will print an error message indicating which test failed and why.

Note: Make sure that you have installed the required Python packages, such as pandas and unittest, before running the script. You can install these packages using pip, which is the package installer for Python.








# Docker Steps: 

To Dockerize this Python code, we will need to create a Docker image that contains all the necessary dependencies and the code itself. Here are the steps to Dockerize this code:

This Dockerfile starts with a Python 3.9 base image, 
sets the working directory to /app, and 
copies the requirements.txt file to the working directory. 
It then installs the requirements using pip and copies the current directory (i.e. the Python code) to the container's /app directory. Finally, 
it sets the command to run the unit test framework with the test_order_data_analysis.py file.

This command runs a new Docker container from the order-data-analysis image, which will execute the CMD specified in the Dockerfile (i.e. run the unittest framework with the test_order_data_analysis.py file).
The output of the tests will be printed to the console. If any test fails, the unittest framework will print an error message indicating which test failed and why.
