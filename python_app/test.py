    # The setUp method is used to load the CSV file and convert the order_date column to a datetime datatype.

#The test_revenue_by_month, test_revenue_by_product, and test_revenue_by_customer methods are used to test the revenue generated by month, product, and customer respectively. Each test method computes the revenue using the same code as in the original program and then checks that the revenue is not empty.

#The test_top_10_customers method is used to test the top 10 customers by revenue generated. The test method computes the revenue by customer and then identifies the top 10 customers by revenue. It then checks that the top 10 customers are not empty.

#To run the tests, we can simply run the Python file containing the tests, which will execute the unittest.main() function and run all the tests. If any test fails, the framework will print an error message indicating which test failed and why.
